# All tool categories and their item and block lists are defined here.
#
# Block list values are 1:1 with in-game IDs. The prepending of "minecraft:" is optional.
# To specify states, do so with [brackets] as you would in a vanilla /setblock command. For
# example, "minecraft:chest[waterlogged=true]" will search for any waterlogged chests. Other
# undefined states will be ignored when checking. Tag keys may also be specified if desired
# by prepending the key with a #. For example, '#minecraft:logs' will reference all log blocks.
#
# Each category may define any of the following options:
# "RepairFriendly", "MaxVeinSize", "Cost", and "DisabledWorlds"
# If NOT defined, the global value (the one in the config.yml) will be used instead.
# Everything except for 'Items' is OPTIONAL. They are not required to be set.
#
# Additionally, 'Priority' may be set to an integer which determines a category's
# priority over another category in the case that they both declare the same item.
# For instance, if two categories have the minecraft:diamond_pickaxe item, the category
# with the highest priority will be selected.
# Please avoid situations where multiple categories have the same item, but if absolutely
# required (e.g. for a permission/hierarchical structure), give each category a priority.
#
# Furthermore, 'NBT' may be set to a string which MUST be on an item under the NBT key
# "PublicBukkitValues": { "veinminer:veinminer": "the_value" }
# For example, a category that defines NBT: "MyValue" must also have the NBT key
# "PublicBukkitValues": { "veinminer:veinminer": "MyValue" }
# If not set, no NBT value is required.
#
# ExampleCategory:
#   RepairFriendly: true
#   MaxVeinSize: 32
#   Cost: 100.0
#   DisabledWorlds:
#   - 'world_name'
#   - 'other_world_name'
#   Priority: 10 # This is optional and defaults to 0
#   NBT: "ExampleValue" # This is optional and defaults to no required NBT
